## Exercise

1. Write a program that swaps two numbers. Given input 143 271 it produces 271 143.
   Note, it is not enough to just print them out in a different order than reading them
   in. You actually have to swap the content of the variables.

2. Write a program that computes the maximum of two integer numbers.

3. Write a program that adds two numbers; write a program that adds three numbers;
   write a program that adds four numbers.

4. Challenge: Write a program that computes the maximum number that can be
   produced by adding at most three arbitrary (possibly negative) integer numbers.
